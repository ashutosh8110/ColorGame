Test your knowledge of RGB color. Look at the number above, and guess which square matches the RGB code.
RGB color space or RGB color system, constructs all the colors from the combination of the Red, Green and Blue colors. The red, green and blue use 8 bits each, which have integer values from 0 to 255. The first number indicates the amount of RED, the second number indicates the amount of GREEN, and the third number indicates the amount of BLUE.
